## Clouds

As they explored, Kittyfish marveled at the peculiar Martian landscape. Strange, fluffy clouds floated by, looking just like cotton candy, and vibrant red flowers with polka-dotted petals waved hello in the gentle breeze. Suddenly, Kittyfish spotted something shimmering in the distance.

“What’s that?” they wondered, scampering over to investigate. To their delight, it was a group of quirky Martian creatures! They had big, googly eyes, long antennae, and wiggly arms that danced in the air.

Every day, Kittyfish would bound joyfully across the red sands of Mars, weaving between the cacti-like flora that dotted the landscape. They were curious about everything: the rustling of the winds, the glimmering of distant stars, and most especially, the mysteries that lay beyond their own planet.

One day, while exploring a sparkling green grove of Martian moss, Kittyfish spotted something strange in the sky. A flash of brilliant colors zipped overhead, and Kittyfish squinted into the bright sunlight. “What was that?” they wondered, feeling a flutter of excitement in their paws.
